# mm-analysis
Calculates the average running times of matrix multiplication algorithms for a large number of randomly generated square matrix inputs for comparison.

Currently, three algorithms are tested using the same set of randomly generated matrices:
* Traditional Iterative Algorithm
* Basic Divide & Conquer Algorithm
* Strassens Algorithm

The program is designed so that algorithms can be added to the benchmark easily using existing interfaces, leaving all the time measurements to an existing system.
